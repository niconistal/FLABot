Features:
--------

- a BrainLet should be (optionally) notified of events (move, create,
...)
WORK IN PROGRESS - (semi)atomatic CLASSPATH
WORK IN PROGRESS - difference lists
  see classes/JavaLog/init/DiffLists.pl
WORK IN PROGRESS - adjust operators' priority to be ISO Prolog compatible.
- :- body. should be parsed and executed. This might be a bit
  difficult because it is necesary to define ':-' as an operator fx, but ':-'
  is already defined and PlOpTable uses a structure that does not support
  multiple values associated to a single key
- C style comments /* ... */
- JavaLog -v should display the version number
- Eclipse (www.eclipse.org) plugin
- NetBeans plugin
WORK IN PROGRESS - JBuilder plugin
  See Developing OpenTools Version 6. Ch. 22, Adding a file node type and a viewer
WORK IN PROGRESS - JEdit plugin:
  syntax highlight (jEdit User's guide, Ch. 9, Writing Edit Modes)
WORK IN PROGRESS - Write an ANT task for building javalog source files
  http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html
  http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/manual/develop.html
- PlList.toStruct should be rewritten as a visitor

Bugs:
----
4.0 + 1 returns an integer -> it should return a float
call((write(a),write(b)) fails
DONE - listToTerm (TermPredicates.listToSTruct) produces an exeption with 
	A1=3,F=f,length(R, A1),!,listToTerm( [F|R], T ).
DONE - copy_term is broken: copy_term(call(A,B,C), R).
DONE - JavaLog/classpath/ClassPath
	* adds \Users\Cristian.... to the system CLASSPATH
- toString2 should take into account operators
- write('  ') --> '  '
- examples/pl/reducer.pl
DONE - examples/pl/nand.pl
	exp -> 'exp'
- examples/pl/meta_qsort.pl
DONE - examples/pl/ham.pl
	connect -> connect_
- examples/pl/boyer.pl
DONE - examples/pl/chat_parser.pl
	not, is, ... quoted
WORK IN PROGRESS - clean input/output implementation... 
PARTIALLY DONE - '!' - write should strip ' ' and \n
DONE - =.. is broken
DONE - functor has some minor problems: 
	functor(foo(a),fo,1)
	functor(X,1.1,0).
DONE - length(L,1.1) produces stack overflow. This occurs in most Prolog
	implementations
